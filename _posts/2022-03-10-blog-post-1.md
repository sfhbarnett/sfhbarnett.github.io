Importing AlphaFold structures directly into Pymol
------

If you want to import AlphaFold (AF2) protein structures into PyMol you might think you need to download the PDB file and then open it from PyMol. However a nice Plugin allows you to directly import structures directly with the `fetchAF2` command. The plugin is available [here](https://github.com/APAJanssen/Alphafold2import "fetchAF2 Github") and can be added via the plugin tab. I seem to have an issue installing the current version but the previous versions work fine.

The plugin will import the structure and colour it based on the uncertainty that AlphaFold assigns to each part of the structure with red being least certain and blue being most certain.

Unforunately this doesn't match the colours that AlphaFold uses to represent the same data. We can use the same colouring with another spectrumany plugin available [here](https://github.com/Pymol-Scripts/Pymol-script-repo "spectrumany Github"). The command to make the colours the same is `spectrumany b,  0xF47D4A 0xFEDB0B 0x64CDF2 0x355DAA`.

The structure is visually different to the one on the EMBL website, with PyMol much less likely to render secondary structures than AF2 and AF2 also rendering some distorted helices.
