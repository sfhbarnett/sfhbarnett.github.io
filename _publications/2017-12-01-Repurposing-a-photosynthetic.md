We characterised the photosynthetic antenna protein CpcA for its capacity to act as a super-resolution label in both SIM and STORM. The really nice property about this protein is that it can accept different chromophores meaning you can swap the label colour without having to do any cloning. The protein also doesn't need an activating laser like many photoswitching proteins.
