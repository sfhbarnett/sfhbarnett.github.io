My first first-author paper. I used a non-destructive readout camera that does not empty the pixel wells after exposures for single-molecule localisation microscopy. This involved imaging and writing the entire processing and analysis pipeline (which we did in both Python and MATLAB) as conventional approaches aren't built for non-destructive readout datasets.
