This work highlighted the native organisation of PSI inside the cyanobacterial thylakoid membrane. My contribution was to use Hyperspectral Confocal Microscopy in collaboration with the Jerilyn Timlin at Sandia National Laboratories to resolve the overlapping fluorescent structures. I also peformed super-resolution SIM to more accurately observe the architecture below the difraction limit.
