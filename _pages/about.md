Hi I'm Sam. I am currrently at the Max Planck Institute for Medical Research in Heidelberg under the guest scholarship program. I did my PhD at the University of Sheffield building and using super-resolution microscopes to study photosynthetic membranes. I then had three excellent years at the Mechanobiology Institute in Singapore studying using optogenetics to study cell motilty.
